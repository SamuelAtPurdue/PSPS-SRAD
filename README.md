<h3><b>Vision</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Our Mission is to create a student researched and designed avionics sled capable of:
<ul>
  <li> Recording and Transmitting all relevant flight data</li>
  <li> Being easily accessed before and during flight through a wireless connection</li>
  <li> Meeting and exceeding the capabilities of the previously flown COTS sled</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h3><b>Primary Mission Requirements</h3>
<hr>
<p>
The Primary Mission Requirements are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> Redundant Systems for critical flight measurements and communication</li>
  <li> A custom build PCB sled capable of handling the G forces of flight</li>
  <li> A User Interface which can interpret data and send information and commands to the rocket</li>
  <li> A method to interpret the critical data in flight in order to trigger charges for chute deployment and recovery</li>
  <li> A reliable communication protocol for sending raw flight data back to the computer on the ground</li>
  <li> Full communication and control from outside the rocket</li>
  <li> Easy access for charging
  <li> Adaptability, robust code, and easy to interpret documentation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h3><b>Secondary Mission Requirements</h3>
<hr>
<p>
The following are not mission critical but are goals but are planned for the future:
<ul>
  <li> Easy to interpret graphical representation of flight data</li>
  <li> Prediction of flight based on weather conditions</li>
  <li> Electronic Buzzer for easier recovery</li>
  <li> Flight prediction and predicted failures</li>
  <li> Noncritical flight data such orientation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<hr>
<p>
The constraints are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> Cost: TBD</li>
  <li> Flyability: Must fit in a 6 inch radius fuselage</li>
  <li> Length and weight should be minimized</li>
</ul>
</p>
